Note:
We include the code of extra credit in updateTransformations function. If you would like to test regular part of the assignment, you need to comment lines 170-184. If you want to test the EXTRA CREDIT part, you should comment lines 162-167. The regular interpolation code includes a InterpolationHelper function. The Catmull-Rom Spline Interpolation code includes a CatmullRomInter function. We also add a setScale function in class Matrix3 to simplify our code. Thank you for grading us!
